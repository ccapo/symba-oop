This is a numerical integrator used for accurately computing the orbits
of celestial bodies. The code computes the mutual gravity between M large
massive bodies and N small massive bodies, but does not compute the mutual
gravity between the N small massive bodies.

This code also includes a prescription for aerodynamic gas drag for the small
bodies, and tidal torques for the large bodies assuming the presence of a
circumstellar gaseous disk.

This code makes use of the object oriented paradigm, and has also been
parallelized using OpenMP directives, but is only designed to handle scenarios
where the number of large massive bodies are less than 1000.

This code requires the following to be installed: 
Intel Fortran compiler v13+ or GNU Fortran compiler v4.8+
GNU C compiler (Optional, for fxdr binary output library)
gnuplot (Optional)
ImageMagick (Optional)
ps2pdf (Optional)
ffmpeg (Optional)

=============================================================================

Before compiling:

- Update the value of SWIFT_HOME in Makefile.Defines with the correct location of this directory
- Ensure the file test_read_only.xdr in the fxdr directory has read-only permissions
- Set the stack size to be unlimited:
  ulimit -s unlimited
- It may be necessary to provide a larger OpenMP stack size:
  export OMP_STACKSIZE=256m

=============================================================================

To compile:

- make all

To run the example:

- Ensure a link to the programs and scripts in the bin directory exist
- cd example; ./@run_swift
- If gnuplot, imagemagick or ffmpeg are not installed, then comment out the last two lines
