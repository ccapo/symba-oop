This is a numerical integrator used for accurately computing the orbits
of celestial bodies. The code computes the mutual gravity between M large
massive bodies and N small massive bodies, but does not compute the mutual
gravity between the N small massive bodies.

This code also includes a prescription for aerodynamic gas drag for the small
bodies, and tidal torques for the large bodies assuming the presence of a
circumstellar gaseous disk.

This code makes use of the object oriented paradigm, and has also been
parallelized using OpenMP directives, but is only designed to handle scenarios
where the number of large massive bodies are less than 1000.

This code requires the following to be installed: 
Intel or GNU Fortran compiler
GNU C compiler (Optional, for fxdr binary output library)
bash (Optional)
gnuplot (Optional)
ImageMagick (Optional)
ps2pdf (Optional)
ffmpeg (Optional)
